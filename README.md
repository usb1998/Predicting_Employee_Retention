# Predicting Employee Retention ‚Äì Logistic Regression

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave a mid-sized technology company. The aim is to provide the HR department with actionable insights that can guide retention strategies and improve workforce stability.

## üìä Key Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: 73.78%
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: 84%
- **Precision**: 71%
- **Optimal Probability Cutoff**: 0.4 (chosen to maximize recall and minimize false negatives)
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (via `statsmodels`)
- **Feature Selection**: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to retain 15 most significant features
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC

## üí° HR Recommendations

Based on model insights, the following 6 strategies are recommended:
1. **Enhance Promotion Opportunities** for long-tenured employees.
2. **Introduce Flexible Work Arrangements**, including remote/hybrid setups.
3. **Improve Work-Life Balance** through wellness programs and flexible hours.
4. **Support High-Level Staff** with mentorship and leadership development.
5. **Reevaluate Role Fit** for highly qualified employees (e.g., PhDs).
6. **Implement Recognition Programs** for long-term employees.
